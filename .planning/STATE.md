### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- DeepAgents >= 0.5.5 as primary Agent framework
- Onion middleware architecture for layered processing
- LightRAG二次開発 for RAG knowledge system
- Playwright CLI mode over MCP for token efficiency
- Three-domain Agent architecture (TestCase / Web / API)
- [Phase 01]: Used Python 3.12 via uv for backend (deepagents 0.5.9, langgraph 1.1.10)
- [Phase 01]: Three agent stubs use five .parent calls for workspace_dir path resolution
- [Phase 01]: Used react-resizable-panels v4 API (orientation, no autoSaveId/order)
- [Phase 01]: Agent tab switching clears threadId to prevent state leakage
- [Phase 01]: Used inline message object in useChat instead of SDK Message type to match StateType shape
- [Phase 01]: Extracted ConfigDialog from inline page.tsx into separate component
- [Phase 02]: Used @tool.func for direct testing of LangChain StructuredTool objects
- [Phase 02]: Separated Excel export scope from RAG/MCP tools to keep plan focused on D-09/D-10/D-11
